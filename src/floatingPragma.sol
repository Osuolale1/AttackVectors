// If you leave a floating pragma in your code (pragma solidity â‰¥ 0.7.0 < 0.9.0.), you will not be sure of which version is been used to compile your code which means that you might encounter unexpected behaviors.

// Solution: You should lock the solidity pragma to a specific solidity version so that you can be sure how the contract will behave once deployed.
